       "1.  **Permanent Construction:** The school erected works of a permanent nature on the property while operating the school.\n",
       "2.  **“Acting Upon the License”:** The construction was carried out “acting upon the license,” meaning the school was utilizing the rights granted to them through the license.\n",

However, the Court rejected this, stating that pleadings didn’t need to reproduce exact wording and that the substance of the respondents’ case was sufficient.\n",

The core of the case was whether the license was automatically revoked because Narain had built permanent structures.\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Legal Basis:** The case hinges on sections of the Indian Easements Act (specifically sections 60-64) which govern licenses.\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Section 60 (Irrevocable Licenses):** The Act outlines conditions under which a license is deemed irrevocable. These include:\n",
       "    *   The license being coupled with a transfer of property and enforced.\n",
       "    *   The licensee executing a permanent work and incurring expenses.\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **The Court’s Ruling:** The court found that *even though* Narain had built permanent structures (meeting one of the conditions for an irrevocable license), the parties could *agree* to make the license revocable despite this.  The court emphasized that the parties’ agreement superseded the automatic implications of the Act. This was based on the principle that if the parties mutually agreed to a different arrangement, it would be upheld.\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Key takeaway:** The case highlights that the automatic provisions of the Easements Act regarding irrevocable licenses can be overridden by a specific agreement between the parties involved. The court prioritizes the parties’ expressed wishes over the general rules of the Act."
